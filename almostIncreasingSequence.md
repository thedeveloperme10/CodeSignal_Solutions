Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)

[input] array.integer sequence

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 105,
-105 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 105.

[output] boolean

Return true if it is possible to remove one element from the array in order to get a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise return false.

### Solution
```
boolean almostIncreasingSequence(int[] sequence)
{
    if(sequence.length<3)
    {
        return true;
    }
    int ans=0;
     for (int i=0;i<sequence.length-1;i++){
        if (sequence[i]>=sequence[i+1]){
            if (i!=0 &&sequence[i+1]<=sequence[i-1])
            {                
                sequence[i+1] = sequence[i];
            }
            ans++;
        }
    }
    return ans<2;
}
```
